# Website Optimization Project

For this project, I will be optimizing a website. 

The optimized site can be found here: https://alianza-clyne.github.io/website-optimization-project/

## Step One: Optimize The Site's Images
----------------------------------------------
Believe it or not, as small as they are, the images on this site are currently taking up a significant portion of the site's space. This not only results in the site's optimization being reduced, but it can also result in the images taking a while to load.

1. Using [Optimizilla] (http://optimizilla.com/), I compressed all of the images on the site. This allowed me to save several bytes of date and improve the site's load time.
